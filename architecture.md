# Core Principles & Architecture

Axiom Cortexâ„¢ is not a monolithic black box. It is a deterministic, auditable system built on a foundation of discrete, verifiable stages. Our architecture is designed for one purpose: to produce a scientifically rigorous and bias-mitigated evaluation of technical talent.

This is achieved through two core concepts: our non-negotiable **Ethical Framework** and our **Phasic Micro-Chunking Protocol**.

### 1. The Ethical, Legal, and Scientific Integrity Framework

This is the supreme governing protocol of the engine. All algorithms are subordinate to these principles.

*   **Zero-Tolerance for Hallucination:** The engine is bound by a legal and ethical directive to prevent harm. Any data, inference, or conclusion not strictly grounded in the provided interview evidence is a critical failure. We do not invent, we analyze.

*   **Systemic Bias Elimination:** Our **Cortez Calibration Layer** and **L2-Aware Mathematical Validation** are not features; they are fundamental components. Their sole purpose is to ensure candidates are evaluated on the substance of their reasoning, not the superficial characteristics of their communication style.

*   **Primacy of Conceptual Fidelity:** We measure the conceptual closeness of an answer to an ideal state, not the recitation of keywords. This is our core defense against penalizing neurodivergent or culturally diverse communication styles.

### 2. The Phasic Micro-Chunking Execution Protocol

To ensure maximum accuracy and prevent premature synthesis, the engine executes in a mandatory, sequential workflow. Each phase is an isolated, auditable "micro-chunk" with validation gates.

*   **Phase 1: Data Ingestion & Validation**
    *   All inputs (Job Description, Transcripts, etc.) are loaded and validated against strict schemas. Foundational documents and the 44 proprietary algorithms are loaded into active memory.

*   **Phase 2: Per-Question Micro-Analysis (AEU Loop)**
    *   Each question-answer pair is processed in isolation. The engine generates an Ideal Answer Blueprint, applies forensic NLP and the L2-Aware calibrations, and scores the answer against our B-Axioms (e.g., Accuracy, Mental Model, Cognitive Load).

*   **Phase 3: Macro-Synthesis & Final Scoring**
    *   Only after all questions are analyzed does synthesis begin. A **Bayesian network** models the hierarchical relationships between all evidence to synthesize latent traits (e.g., Architectural Instinct, Problem-Solving Agility) with calibrated uncertainty.

*   **Phase 4: Report Assembly**
    *   The final, comprehensive Markdown report is constructed from the validated outputs of the previous phases.

*   **Phase 5: Pre-Execution Validation**
    *   A final, non-negotiable validation protocol runs to ensure every algorithm and process has been executed with absolute fidelity. **The report is not generated until 100% of these checks are confirmed.**

This structured, gated approach ensures that every output is traceable, verifiable, and scientifically sound.
