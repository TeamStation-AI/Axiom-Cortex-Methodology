      <h1>Axiom Cortex™: A Methodology Brief</h1>
      <p>Let’s be blunt. The nearshore industry is a sea of sameness. You’ve seen the pitch decks from the usual suspects—BairesDev, Tecla, Deel—and they all boil down to the same thing: a database of résumés and a promise to fill seats. It’s a numbers game. A keyword-matching lottery.</p>
      <p>And it’s fundamentally broken.</p>
      <p>We didn’t set out to build a better version of that broken model. We decided to build a different machine entirely. This document is a look under the hood. It’s for the technical leaders who care about the <strong>how</strong> because they know the <strong>how</strong> is the only thing that guarantees the <strong>what</strong>.</p>
      <h2>The Core Idea: Stop Guessing, Start Engineering</h2>
      <p>At the heart of the TeamStation product is our platform, the <strong>Nearshore IT Co-Pilot™</strong>. And at the heart of that platform is our engine: <strong>Axiom Cortex™</strong>.</p>
      <p>Axiom Cortex isn’t a search tool. It’s a cognitive evaluation engine designed to do one thing: transform team building from a game of chance into a deterministic engineering discipline. It’s built on a non-negotiable principle: zero-tolerance for hallucination. Every insight is grounded, every claim is auditable, and every process is designed to measure one thing—a candidate’s actual ability to think and execute.</p>
      <p>It’s powered by 44 proprietary algorithms. Not off-the-shelf models, but a purpose-built stack of psychometric, behavioral, and technical analyzers.</p>
      <h2>The "Secret Sauce" Isn't a Secret, It's Just Hard Work</h2>
      <p>Any system is only as good as its inputs and its refusal to take shortcuts. Here’s a sample of the methodologies that make our engine different:</p>
      <ol>
        <li>
          <strong>The L2-Aware Validation Layer</strong><br>
          This is probably the most important thing we’ve built. Standard NLP models are notoriously biased against non-native English speakers. They mistake linguistic artifacts—like a different sentence structure or a slight accent—for a lack of clarity or skill. It’s a critical flaw that disqualifies incredible talent for the wrong reasons.<br>
          Our L2-Aware layer fixes this. Think of it like noise-cancellation for an interview. It uses a suite of techniques to isolate the <em>signal</em> (the quality of the thinking) from the <em>noise</em> (the linguistic delivery).
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Proficiency-Normalized Scoring</strong>:<br>
          We mathematically separate semantic content from grammatical form errors, ensuring we’re not penalizing someone for thinking in two languages.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Cross-Lingual Semantics</strong>:<br>
          We use multilingual embeddings and techniques like Fréchet Semantic Distance so that a concept explained in Spanish-influenced English is understood to be identical to one explained by a native speaker. No translation applied.
        </li>
