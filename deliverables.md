# Deliverables: The Evidence-Based Report

The output of the Axiom Cortex™ engine is not a subjective opinion; it is a comprehensive, auditable, and data-rich intelligence asset. Each evaluation produces a single, unabridged Markdown report designed to provide a level of clarity and evidence that is simply unattainable through traditional methods.

Our reports are engineered to be the ground truth for your hiring decisions.

### 1. The Cognitive & Psychometric Profile

This is the core of the report. It provides a deep, multi-dimensional analysis of a candidate's cognitive and behavioral traits, moving far beyond a simple skills checklist.

*   **The Cognitive Fingerprint:** A high-visibility visualization of the four core latent traits (Architectural Instinct, Problem-Solving Agility, Learning Orientation, Collaborative Mindset). Each trait is scored, benchmarked against the ideal for the role, and justified with direct, evidence-based rationale.

*   **Metacognitive Conviction Index (MCI):** A proprietary gauge that assesses how well a candidate's confidence is calibrated with their actual knowledge. This is a critical predictor of coachability and intellectual honesty, and it flags potential Dunning-Kruger risks.

### 2. The Evidence Locker

This is our commitment to zero-tolerance for hallucination made manifest. For every single question in the interview, the report contains a complete, auditable evidence trail.

*   **Ideal Answer Blueprint:** The benchmark for an expert-level answer, generated from the job description and our foundational models.
*   **Full, Untruncated Transcript Citation:** The candidate's complete, unedited answer to the question.
*   **Ghostevidence™ & Must-Have Alignment:** Direct quotes from the transcript are cited as "Ghostevidence" to prove the alignment (or lack thereof) with every "Must-Have" skill.
*   **Linguistic & NLP Analysis:** A summary of the key data signals from our L2-Aware Validation Layer, explaining how the candidate's communication patterns influenced the final, calibrated scores.
*   **UCE Axiom Scoring:** A full breakdown of the five B-Axiom scores (Procedural Knowledge, Mental Model, Accuracy, Clarity, Cognitive Load) with justifications.

### 3. The Final Recommendation: A Data-Driven Decision

The final recommendation is not a "gut feeling." It is the output of our Constrained Bayesian Decision Theory model.

*   **A Quantifiable Score:** A final, calibrated score (e.g., 4.2 / 5.0) with uncertainty bands, derived from our Bayesian network synthesis.
*   **A Clear Recommendation:** A direct "Strong Hire," "Hire," "Hire with Reservations," or "No Hire" recommendation.
*   **An Actionable Justification:** A concise, evidence-based summary explaining *why* the recommendation was made, referencing the final score, the results of the Core Competency Gating, and the key findings from the Cognitive & Psychometric Profile.

This comprehensive, evidence-based deliverable is the final output of the **Nearshore IT Co-Pilot™** platform. It is designed to give you and your team the data, the evidence, and the confidence to build your team with engineered precision.
