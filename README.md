# Axiom Cortex™: A Technical Methodology Brief

This document provides a public-facing overview of the scientific principles, architectural design, and mathematical foundations of **Axiom Cortex™**, the proprietary cognitive AI engine that powers the **TeamStation Nearshore IT Co-Pilot™** platform.

This is not a marketing document. It is a declaration of methodology intended for a technical audience of CTOs, CIOs, and VPs of Engineering who demand a higher standard of rigor, transparency, and performance from their talent infrastructure.

Our approach is built on a foundation of peer-reviewed research in computational linguistics, psychometrics, and artificial intelligence. The engine is an auditable, multi-layered system designed for unparalleled accuracy and fairness, powered by **44 proprietary algorithms**.

### Explore the Methodology

This microsite provides a high-level overview of the key scientific domains that underpin our engine.

*   **[Core Architecture & Principles](architecture.md):** An overview of our non-negotiable ethical framework and the Phasic Micro-Chunking Protocol that ensures auditable, deterministic results.

*   **[Latent Trait & Psychometric Analysis](latent-traits.md):** A look at how we measure the four core traits—Architectural Instinct, Problem-Solving Agility, Learning Orientation, and Collaborative Mindset—that are the strongest predictors of on-the-job success.

*   **[Scientific Foundations & Validation](scientific-foundations.md):** A deep dive into the specific mathematical and scientific models that power our engine, including our L2-Aware Validation Layer, Network Psychometrics, and Constrained Bayesian Decision Theory.
